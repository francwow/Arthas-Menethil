        <h2>Life and death of a prince</h2>
        <ul class="info-list">
          <li>
            Prince Arthas Menethil was born to King Terenas Menethil II and
            Queen Lianne Menethil, four years before the start of the First War.
          </li>
          <li>
            He learned the ways of the Light under the tutelage of Uther the
            Lightbringer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arthas was inducted into the Knights of the Silver Hand at the young
            age of 19.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having grown into a strong, confident young man, Arthas was
            headstrong and somewhat arrogant, though none could dispute his
            bravery and tenacity. Arthas came to be considered one of the finest
            swordsmen in Lordaeron, and was famed for counterattacking and
            defeating the forest troll warbands of Zul'Aman when they began
            raiding the settlements along the border of Quel'Thalas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Years later a vile threat arose in the form of the Plague of
            Undeath. Jaina and Captain Falric were sent to help Arthas, now 24
            years old, investigate the strange disease. They fought against the
            undead at an infested granary, then encountered the necromancer
            Kel'Thuzad in the town of Brill and pursued him to Andorhal.
          </li>
          <li>
            When he arrived at Stratholme, Arthas found that the grain had
            already been distributed. He knew the people of Stratholme would
            soon become undead, and ordered Uther and his knights to purge the
            entire city. As Arthas began to slay the citizens of Stratholme, he
            was met by Mal'Ganis himself, who was working to claim their souls.
            Arthas sought to destroy them before Mal'Ganis could reach them, and
            eventually demanded a final showdown with the dreadlord. Mal'Ganis
            slipped away, however, vowing to meet him in Northrend.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the frozen continent he met with Muradin Bronzebeard who was
            looking for the runed blade Frostmourne.
          </li>
          <li>
            They went deep into the iced caverns were they finally found the
            legendary sword.
          </li>
          <li>
            Muradin saw that the blade was cursed and tried to convince Arthas
            to leave it behind, but the now crazed prince replied "I'll give
            anything or pay any price, if only this blade will help me save my
            people".
          </li>
          <li>
            After claiming the cursed Frostmourne for himself, Arthas left the
            caverns and slayed all his men with it. Muradin was left for dead
            deep inside Dragonblight.
          </li>
          <li>
            He found Mal'Ganis and killed him in Icecrown, there he ascended the
            frozen throne to be proclaimed as the first Lich King.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arthas returned to Lordaeron months later, and the kingdom rejoiced
            at the return of its champion. Flanked by Falric and Marwyn, Arthas
            entered the imperial chamber and knelt before the throne. After
            telling his father that he no longer needed to bear the weight of
            his crown, Arthas walked up to Terenas and ran Frostmourne through
            his heart. The king's bloodied, broken crown remains lost to this
            day. As he drew Frostmourne, Arthas remembered the words of his old
            friend Varian describing his own father and king Llane being stabbed
            in the heart.
